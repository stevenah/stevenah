### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven Hicksâ€”a researcher and developer based in Oslo, Norway. Welcome to my GitHub page!

Currently, I work at SimulaMet as a research scientist and serve as the CTO of Innsikt.AI, a startup focused on developing software designed to train police and social workers in conducting interviews with potentially abused children. I also have an adjunct associate professor position at OsloMet where I work on using machine learning to aid in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders.
