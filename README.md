### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven Hicksâ€”a researcher and developer based in Oslo, Norway.

Currently, I work at [SimulaMet](https://www.simulamet.no/) as a research scientist and serve as the CTO of [Innsikt.AI](https://innsikt.ai/), a startup focused on developing software designed to train police and social workers in conducting interviews with potentially abused children. I also have an adjunct associate professor position at [OsloMet](https://www.oslomet.no/) where I work on using machine learning to aid in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders.

You can find more about my work on my [personal website](https://stevenhicks.xyz/) and on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2fVVFSwAAAAJ&hl=en).
